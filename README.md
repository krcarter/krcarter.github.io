# Kamal Carter's Update Website

This repo is built on a fork of **Jekyll Now** from [this repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). **Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

The website design is just a modification of [Jon Barron's website](https://jonbarron.info/) and is converted for my own use, re-purposing my old markdown posts. **Feel free to use template for your own purposes**, but please respect copyright for all the images/content in my `images`, `pdfs`, `_posts` folders. 

This website is then a modifcation of [Leonid Keselman](https://github.com/leonidk/leonidk.github.io) that made the site simpler with markdown
