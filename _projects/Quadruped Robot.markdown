# Overview
<br />

My team worked together to build and optimized a walking robot for search and rescue operations in confined space. The robot was powered by a single motor, and legs of the robot consist of four identical four bar linkages. We designed our robot to have an animal gait mimicking a dog trot. To do this we planned for our four-bar linkage mechanism to follow a sideways “D”. In our simulation we got our desired curved close, but not exact. We wanted the coupler curve to be a sideways "D". We wanted the coupler curve to be a sideways "D" to optimize the robot time spent walking forward, and to have a curve height to overcome obstacles.

# Prototypes/ Renders
<br />

Before Getting to our final design we went through several prototype iterations.

First Design: We try to have our legs actually be the sidaways "D" coupler curve that we desired.

Second Design: Close to what we wanted, but couldn't get over some obstacles well

Third Design: This was the design we ended up settling for.
