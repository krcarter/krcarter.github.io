# Overview
<br />

For Carnegie Mellon’s Rapid Prototype Design (39-245) class myself and two other students built a shake table to simulate an earthquake. The objective of the project was to design, build and test prototypes of a toy game or activity that engages children in hands-on learning about the physical world for the STEM in a shoebox project. Our project must engage a child’s curiosity to learn, appeal to all types of children with differing levels of knowledge and abilities, be safe and durable, use appropriate and sustainable technology, and for in a large showbox. 

So as a team we set out to design a project that would be small and portable to fit in a shoebox, but still interest students. After initial deliberation we went with the idea of a shake table that could simulate an earthquake because kids love to see things break. However, not only will kids be able to break thins they will be able to understand how seismic activity works and how exciting structures in different ways lead to different results.


# Prototype
<br />

To prototype our design idea, we used very simple materials just to test if our overall design would work. We tested the idea of using rubber bands which are cheap, easily disposable, and easy for young children to understand. To shake the table, we used a cheap DC motor and 2 AA batteries, and attached an unbalanced mass to excite the oscillation.

# Final Design

For the final design we went from using our cardboard box design to manufacturing the shake table with lasered-cut acrylic. Laser cutting made it easy to reiterate the design.
