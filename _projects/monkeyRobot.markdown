# Abstract
<br />

Gibbons and similar animals exhibit agile maneuverability with the complex, pendulum-like motion of their legs or tails when swinging from branch to branch (brachiation). Tailed robots developed by Fukuda et al., Chang-Sui et al., and others have each separately shown the robust capabilities tail-like appendages have for modifying robotic movement to improve brachiation and aerial reorientation during a fall. However, a system which combines both of these tail capabilities has yet to be studied. To this end, we developed a bioinspired, three-link swinging robot, in the vein of a triple pendulum, that can modify its motion by means of motor actuation of its lower two links (its tail). By comparing the three-link robotâ€™s ability to swing from rest and reorient in-air to its two-link counterpart, we can study more generally how tails can modify robotic movement, and theoretically gain a better understanding of robotic locomotion. A MATLAB trajectory optimization simulation of the two and three-link robot indicated that a three-link configuration increased maximum achievable velocity while decreasing required torque when swinging from rest. However, during reorientation simulations, the three-link robot required more torque on average to change from a vertical position to a horizontal orientation while falling. Studies conducted with the final prototype were inconclusive with respect to swinging, but seemed to indicate that the three-link configuration was more effective at reorientation. From our experiments we can generally conclude that a tail with greater ability to change its moment of inertia tends to be more effective at robotic motion manipulation, however more testing is required to confirm this fact.
