# Overview
<br />

This was my capstone project for my senior year of undergrad at Carnegie Mellon in 24-671 Electromechanical Systems Design. I was on a 5 person team with four other mechanical engineering senior. 

This project focuses on building a household automated cocktail machine that makes drinks from the original liquid ingredients. Currently, similar devices either use prepackaged cocktail mixes or are still in development and cost at least $300 to pre-order. Making cocktails can be time-consuming and imprecise, particularly when done at home. Automating this process can reduce time spent away from guest at parties and allow people to control exactly what is in their drink. The Design challenge was to create a system that could pour, stir, and shake drinks quickly and accurately.

# Customer Needs

We compiled the suggestions from the survey, identified similarities/trends, and converted the vague needs to comprehensible customer needs. As a design team, we also added customer needs that we felt were important to its functionality as a household appliance, such as some of the safety and general needs. Below are two tables: one is a chart of our customer needs, and the other is the objective tree for our customer needs.

# Early Prototypes/ Renders (PDR)
<br />

To assure the success and have an understanding of the difficulty of the project we did a lot of prototyping. We broke the prototyping into five subassemblies: storage, handling, extended stations, stirring, and shaking. Below are early renders of what we thought each system would look like during our preliminary design review.

Storage


# Mid-level Prototypes (CDR)
<br />

After we access the feasibility of our project, we then prepare for our critical design review (CDR), where we had in depth measurements and placements of all our parts. Here is where we bought critical parts and see if they worked. 

For the storage and handling system we tested our pumps and tubing. To pour our drinks we went with a peristaltic pump from Trossen Robotics with a flow rate of 2L/min. We ran test for repeatability and the minimum amount of liquid we could precisely pour. Here we observed that there was leaking from the pumps through the tube. As result of this leakage we went from having our liquid bottles from on top of our prototype to the side for no spillage.

The extended station was operated by a stepper motor, for accurate open-loop control, to drive a lead screw. This system was inspired by how 3d printers work. The shaking mechanism we finalize the dimensions for a slider-crank system and a servo-controlled claw. Last we bought and finish the CAD for our stirring mechanism.
