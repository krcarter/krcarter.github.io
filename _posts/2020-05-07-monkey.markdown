Developed a bioinspired, three-link swinging robot, in the vein of a triple pendulum, that can modify its motion by means of motor actuation of its lower two links (its tail). By comparing the three-link robotâ€™s ability to swing from rest and reorient in-air to its two-link counterpart, we can study more generally how tails can modify robotic movement, and theoretically gain a better understanding of robotic locomotion. A MATLAB trajectory optimization simulation of the two and three-link robot indicated that a three-link configuration increased maximum achievable velocity while decreasing required torque when swinging from rest.
