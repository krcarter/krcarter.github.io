Using Unitree's H1 Humanoid to learn different track events (40 yard, 100 meter, 100 meter hurdle, 200 meter, 400 meters, 1500 meters) using RL reward policy. In the future I want to do retarting work using visual data gather especially for the 40 yard dash since there is a lot of training footage from YouTube as a way not to have to spend so much time tuning intial rewards.
