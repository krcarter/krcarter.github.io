Here are a few of my projects I have work on over the years. These projects are from work, classes, or personal hobby projects.

## HEBI Robotics - Application Designer - Agile Inspection Robots - 2023

* Helped onboard customers with our inspection robots.
* Designed custom robotics solutions in Python & Matlab to support customers needs
* Maintain documentation and manuals for robotics solutions
* Led robotics demos for conferences (i.e. ICRA & ROS) and webinars
* Created YouTube video course tutorials and examples for actuator controls and robot kinematics
* Wrote and pitch, and led government contracts for the Air Force

## Python/Computer Vision - Robot Aimbot - 2022

For a personal project of mine, I made a physical robot that moved a mouse around to shoot targets on the screen. The robot moved using knowledge of where the targets were on the screen and then doing PID control to send a velocity command to the motors.

Software Tools

* Computer Vision - (OpenCV)
* Object Detection (PyTorch - Yolov)
* Controls - PID
* Odometry - Model Omnidirectional Robot

## ROS/GAZEBO - Passive Walking Simulation - 2019

For my graduate research study I deployed a working simulation of a simple passive dynamic walking. Modeling rigid bodies and real world friction parameters.

## Ballbot - Balancing Robot - 2019

Spring  2019 capstone project for 16-264 Humanoids Class at Carnegie Mellon University.

The projects was greatly inspired by [Ballbot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BtDuzu2WeI) a humanoid size robot made in CMU's Microdynamic Systems Laboratory. Instead of balancing on a ball with a 200mm (7.87 inches) diameter we built our robot to balance on a smaller ball with a 95mm (3.75 inches) diameter.

Robot Control

* Modeled as two decoupled planar systems
* PID (innerloop for ball velocity)
* LQR (outerloop)
* Full State Feedback Control (outer loop)

**Balancing**

Mechanical Design

* Primarily Assembled with Laser Cutting & 3D Printing
* 4 Brushed DC Motors with Encoders
* 3.75 inch dimater ball
