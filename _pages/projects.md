Here are a few of my projects I have work on over the years. These projects are from work, classes, or personal hobby projects.

## HEBI Robotics - Application Designer - Agile Inspection Robots

I helped onboard customers with our inspection robots, run demo using Python, and work to create videos of our robotics systems

## ROS/GAZEBO - Passive Walking Simulation

For my graduate research study I deployed a working simulation of a simple passive dynamic walking. Modeling rigid bodies and real world friction parameters.

## Python/Computer Vision - Robot Aimbot

For a personal project of mine, I made a physical robot that moved a mouse around to shoot targets on the screen. The robot moved using knowledge of where the targets were on the screen and then doing PID control to send a velocity command to the motors.
